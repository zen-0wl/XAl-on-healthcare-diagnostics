        <h1>Enhancing Interpretability of AI-Driven Healthcare Diagnostics</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In the era of AI-driven diagnosis, prediction, and treatment for chronic illnesses, the opaqueness of AI models poses a critical challenge. This research addresses the imperative need to enhance transparency and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI) applications within the healthcare domain. We employ Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, ELI5, QLattice, LIME, and Anchor, in conjunction with machine learning algorithms, to bring clarity and comprehensibility to AI in healthcare. Our approach leverages supervised deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) for medical image interpretation, ensuring the dual goals of accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, ensemble methods like random forests and decision trees contribute significantly to the enhancement of AI-driven healthcare diagnostics' interpretability and trustworthiness. This research holds significant promise for healthcare. By making AI-driven diagnostics more interpretable, we unlock the potential for personalized and effective treatment plans. Healthcare professionals can confidently rely on AI recommendations, leading to improved patient care and outcomes. Moreover, patients gain a deeper understanding of their diagnoses and treatment options, fostering trust in the medical decision-making process. Our work bridges the gap between AI's capabilities and the need for transparency and trust in healthcare, promising a more reliable future in medical diagnostics and treatment.</p>

                    <h4>Insights</h4>
                    <p>The provided classification report indicates that the model is highly accurate in predicting the absence of stroke based on smoking status, with a precision of 0.95, recall of 1.00, and F1-score of 0.97. This suggests that the model is very effective in identifying cases where smoking status is not associated with the absence of stroke.
                        The high accuracy and F1-score indicate that the model is able to correctly classify most instances where smoking status does not contribute to the absence of stroke. The precision of 0.95 suggests that the model is also able to correctly identify the absence of stroke in most cases where smoking status is not a factor.
                        The low precision and recall for the class where smoking status is not associated with the absence of stroke (0.00) may indicate that there are some instances where the model incorrectly classifies these cases. However, the overall accuracy of 0.95 and the high F1-score suggest that the model is generally effective in identifying the relationship between smoking status and the absence of stroke.
                        Overall, the insights from this classification report suggest that smoking status is a strong predictor of the absence of stroke, and the model is able to accurately identify instances where smoking status does not contribute to the absence of stroke.</p>

                    <p>The visualisations gives us insight of relationships between smoking status on the absence of stroke that individuals who have never smoked exhibit a lower likelihood of stroke compared to those who currently or formerly smoked. The dataset, however, has a bias towards non-smokers and those with unknown smoking status, which may have an affect on the analysis accuracy. Despite this, the overall trend indicates that current smokers have a higher stroke risk, aligning with existing medical knowledge.</p>

This suggests that the model is effective in capturing the relationship between average glucose levels and the probability of stroke.
                        The low MSE indicates that the model is able to accurately predict the probability of stroke for a given average glucose level. This is consistent with the findings in the literature that higher average glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of stroke.</p>

                    <p>The model achieves a high accuracy of 94.6%, indicating it performs well in correctly classifying stroke and non-stroke cases in the test data. However, there's a significant imbalance in the classification results.
                        
                            Precision for class 0 (no stroke) is very high (0.95), meaning most of the predicted negative cases (no stroke) were actually negative.
                            Precision for class 1 (stroke) is 0, which means the model struggles to identify actual stroke cases (positive class). This is further confirmed by a recall of 0 for stroke cases. The model might be predicting all cases as negative (no stroke).

                        Due to the class imbalance, F1-score, which considers both precision and recall, might not be a reliable measure of overall performance.</p>

                    <p>Examining the collective influence of age and BMI on stroke likelihood as analyzed from Figure 6, the SHAP plots show that age is a dominant predictor, with older age significantly increasing stroke risk. BMI also contributes to stroke risk but to a lesser extent than age. The interaction between these features suggests that while age is a crucial factor, managing BMI is also important for mitigating stroke risk, particularly in individuals with high BMI.</p>
